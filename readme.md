# 🍷 Red Wine Quality Prediction

This project is a Bayesian analysis of the **Vinho Verde red wine dataset**, aiming to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. It is built using Python and Stan (via `cmdstanpy`), and structured for reproducible analysis inside a Dockerized environment.

The notebook walks through:
- problem formulation and causal structure (DAG),
- preprocessing and feature selection,
- model specification in Stan (multiple versions),
- prior/posterior predictive checks,
- model comparison using WAIC and PSIS-LOO.

## Running inside cmdstanpy Docker container

To run the notebook inside a container with `cmdstanpy` installed:

1. **Clone this repository** inside the container’s working directory (`/projekt`):

```bash
mkdir -p /projekt
cd /projekt
git clone <your-repo-url> .
```

2. **Make sure the dataset is in place**:
Place the CSV file here:  
`/projekt/data/winequality-red.csv`

> If not present, you can download it from:  
> [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

3. **Install Python dependencies** using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the notebook**:
You can use Jupyter, JupyterLab, or VS Code with a remote kernel linked to the container.
